the easiest way to start a nice looking docs site
  good starting point for low-effort nice-looking single page docs

  simple static thing you can dev locally, push to gh pages

just add html
...we've taken care of the basics so you can get started easily

easy install / setup
it's just a single file, ext css & js included from cdn
assets load from cdn, so it's just a single file, sensible default config


easy customization
it's just basic/vanilla css & js, add your own whatever, customize to your hearts content, make it yours
easily extendable (add however much content) it's just html! put it on any server! (perfect for gh pages, btw)

nice defaults
Sidebar with auto-highlighting, responsive structure (sidebar turns into dropdown on mobile), AND A NICE DEFAULT DESIGN

future improvements planned
- planned support for easy theme w/ css vars
automatically generate menu based on content
even better turn-key code highlighter experience





<li>semantic html document structure, simple straightforward architecture ... almost easy as writing markdown (html is semantic, doesnâ€™t have extra classes</li>


<li>highlight.js for syntax highlighting</li>

<li>Nav that keeps up with scrolling</li>

<li>Single page like KNEX docs</li>

<li>Themeable (at some point...easy to edit for now)</li>

<li>bolt.css simple basic reset, also :root css vars</li>

<li>It's just a single file!</li>

<li>Looks nice (and normal) without a lot of work ... EASY TO USE (& customize) / work with ... simple static thing you can dev locally, push to gh pages * for making ~beautiful~ single-page docs sites</li>

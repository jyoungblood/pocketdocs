# Pocket Docs

Are you looking for an attractive semantic HTML template for writing single-page documentation? 

You're going to love this!

## An expedient panacea for documentation

Writing documentation can be difficult, especially when many "turn-key" solutions require an involved installation and configuration process. It's often easier to start with a single HTML file, but even then it's tempting to get lost in the details building the base structure and configuring defaults needed to create something nice.

Pocket Docs provides a sensible default configuration that lets you focus on writing content. It's a single static HTML file that you can develop to meet your specific needs...and it looks good without any effort!


- **Just add HTML** - We've taken care of the basic structure so you can get started easily. Add your content as semantic HTML (almost as easy as writing Markdown).

- **Minimal architecture** - It's [just a single file](https://github.com/jyoungblood/pocketdocs/blob/master/index.html), external CSS & JS libraries included from CDN. Ready to deploy in any environment.

- **Sensible defaults** - Includes syntax highlighting, responsive sidebar/dropdown navigation, scroll-based nav highlighting, AND A NICE DEFAULT DESIGN

- **Easy customization** - Made with basic HTML, CSS, and JS. Add any library or your own code to make it what you want it to be.

- **Future improvements planned** - Upcoming support for easy themes using CSS variables, automatically generating navigation based on content, and even better code highlighting experience. Stay tuned...

# Pocket Docs
### It's just a file

(this is a work in progress, icyww)

check out the demo: https://jyoungblood.github.io/pocketdocs


[ ] include a screenshot once the boilerplate is looking good

HTML template for a single-page docs site. Incorporates bolt.css and code blocks w/ highlight.js
  just a single html file


simple static thing you can dev locally, push to gh pages
* for making ~beautiful~ single-page docs sites
simple stack & boilerplate, good starting point for low-effort nice-looking single page docs
designed to be a single page, easily extendable (add however much content) it's just html! put it on any server! (perfect for gh pages, btw)

assets load from cdn, so it's just a single file, sensible default config


the easiest way to start a nice looking docs site

Sidebar with auto-highlighting, responsive design (kinda?), AND A NICE DEFAULT DESIGN

(future) themeable - future easy theme w/ css vars

straightforward architecture, semantic html document structure
  - almost as easy as writing markdown (html is semantic, doesn’t have extra classes

inspired by OG knex docs (among others)
  for years i loved the knex docs because it was a single page. lots of info, but really easy to find everything and use the library


want to serve this all from a cdn but you gotta have the css & js for now ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

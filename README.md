# Pocket Docs
### It's just a file

(this is a work in progress, icyww)

check out the demo: https://jyoungblood.github.io/pocketdocs


[ ] include a screenshot once the boilerplate is looking good

HTML template for a single-page docs site. Incorporates bolt.css and code blocks w/ highlight.js
  just a single html file

  it's just html, so the sky's the limit on what you COULD do, this just gives you a nice starting point to have something nice without any effort (just as easy as writing a readme)




              <li>semantic html structure, simple straightforward architecture ... almost easy as writing markdown (html is semantic, doesn’t have extra classes</li>

              <li>highlight.js for syntax highlighting</li>

              <li>Nav that keeps up with scrolling</li>

              <li>Single page like KNEX docs</li>

              <li>Themeable (at some point...easy to edit for now)</li>

              <li>bolt.css simple basic reset, also :root css vars</li>

              <li>It's just a single file!</li>

              <li>Looks nice (and normal) without a lot of work ... EASY TO USE (& customize) / work with ... simple static thing you can dev locally, push to gh pages * for making ~beautiful~ single-page docs sites</li>




simple static thing you can dev locally, push to gh pages
* for making ~beautiful~ single-page docs sites
simple stack & boilerplate, good starting point for low-effort nice-looking single page docs
designed to be a single page, easily extendable (add however much content) it's just html! put it on any server! (perfect for gh pages, btw)

assets load from cdn, so it's just a single file, sensible default config


the easiest way to start a nice looking docs site

Sidebar with auto-highlighting, responsive design (kinda?), AND A NICE DEFAULT DESIGN

(future) themeable - future easy theme w/ css vars

straightforward architecture, semantic html document structure
  - almost as easy as writing markdown (html is semantic, doesn’t have extra classes

inspired by OG knex docs (among others)
  for years i loved the knex docs because it was a single page. lots of info, but really easy to find everything and use the library


want to serve this all from a cdn but you gotta have the css & js for now ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

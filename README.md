### It's just a file



are you looking for a semantic html template for writing single-page documentation? you're going to love this!

just add html
...we've taken care of the basics so you can get started easily

easy install
it's just a single file, ext css & js included from cdn

easy customization
it's just basic/vanilla css & js, add your own whatever, customize to your hearts content, make it yours



check out the demo: https://jyoungblood.github.io/pocketdocs








You don't always need docusaurus or whatever, esp when you're starting something
  You need a simple easy thing to get started
   Docs are always put off for last and it seems so daunting, it's a lot easier if you have a simple easy way to get something useful and attractive


a simple skeleton that you can build something nice on


(this is a work in progress, icyww)


- note: codeblocks for html chars have to be encoded (link to h2ml encoder)

- note: weird janky way you have to format your code blocks (working on a fix for the future, no blank lines at top/bottom, indentation has to go all the way to the left...sorry)

everything you need is in index.html
if you want to remove the cdn links and use the local versions, that's fine too

[ ] include a screenshot once the boilerplate is looking good

HTML template for a single-page docs site. Incorporates bolt.css and code blocks w/ highlight.js
  just a single html file

  it's just html, so the sky's the limit on what you COULD do, this just gives you a nice starting point to have something nice without any effort (just as easy as writing a readme)




              <li>semantic html structure, simple straightforward architecture ... almost easy as writing markdown (html is semantic, doesn’t have extra classes</li>

              <li>highlight.js for syntax highlighting</li>

              <li>Nav that keeps up with scrolling</li>

              <li>Single page like KNEX docs</li>

              <li>Themeable (at some point...easy to edit for now)</li>

              <li>bolt.css simple basic reset, also :root css vars</li>

              <li>It's just a single file!</li>

              <li>Looks nice (and normal) without a lot of work ... EASY TO USE (& customize) / work with ... simple static thing you can dev locally, push to gh pages * for making ~beautiful~ single-page docs sites</li>




simple static thing you can dev locally, push to gh pages
* for making ~beautiful~ single-page docs sites
simple stack & boilerplate, good starting point for low-effort nice-looking single page docs
designed to be a single page, easily extendable (add however much content) it's just html! put it on any server! (perfect for gh pages, btw)

assets load from cdn, so it's just a single file, sensible default config


the easiest way to start a nice looking docs site

Sidebar with auto-highlighting, responsive design (kinda?), AND A NICE DEFAULT DESIGN

(future) themeable - future easy theme w/ css vars

straightforward architecture, semantic html document structure
  - almost as easy as writing markdown (html is semantic, doesn’t have extra classes

inspired by OG knex docs (among others)
  for years i loved the knex docs because it was a single page. lots of info, but really easy to find everything and use the library


want to serve this all from a cdn but you gotta have the css & js for now ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

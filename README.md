# Pocket Docs
### It's just a file

(this is a work in progress, icyww)

check out the demo: https://jyoungblood.github.io/pocketdocs


HTML template for a single-page docs site. Incorporates tachyons and code blocks w/ prism.js

the easiest way to start a nice looking docs site

Sidebar with auto-highlighting, responsive design (kinda?), AND A NICE DEFAULT DESIGN

(future) themeable

straightforward architecture

inspired by OG knex docs (among others)
  for years i loved the knex docs because it was a single page. lots of info, but really easy to find everything and use the library

here's the default prism theme:
- https://prismjs.com/download.html#themes=prism-okaidia&languages=markup+css+clike+javascript+apacheconf+handlebars+markup-templating+nginx+php+sql&plugins=normalize-whitespace+toolbar+copy-to-clipboard
make your own & replace the prism.css & prism.js

probably gonna get a different syntax highlighter in the future

want to serve this all from a cdn but you gotta have the css & js for now ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
